<h2> Projects</h2>
<br>
<p>With this project, I was to create a functioning website with a minimum of 4 pages, use HTML5 semantic elements, properly organize code with HTML elements properly nested, at least 1 external style sheet properly linked to each page, a minimum of at least one CSS style applied for padding, margin, border, width, color, background-color, and font-family, create relevant content related to subject, and include at least 1 heading, 1 list, 1 paragraph and 1 image per page.
</p>
<p>This project was extensive and showcases my ability and experience with creating a functional, multipage website.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> This is a project that I completed as my final project for CITPT-111 - Web Development Fundamentals. This is a static, mulity page website that has properly oganized code with HTML elements properly nested.  
</p>
<p>This website shows my ability to make creative, unique, simple websites. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This is an example of using SASS and HTM to create a simple website, quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>With this project, I was to use SASS as my CSS processor. I also had to employ as much HTML as needed to ensure all of the following SCSS functionality were met; variables, nesting, mixins, extend/inheritance, and operatiors.
</p>
<p>This project showcases my experience with using CSS processors such as SASS.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> This is an example of a web page I created using a CSS Framework. The primary goal of this project was to give me the ability and practice creating and using a CSS framework to develop a website.
</p>
<p> With this project, I was to create a one-page website using a CSS Framework of my choosing and to use at least 5 components of my choice (buttons, grids, cards, modals, etc). 
</p>
<p>This projec showcases my experience with using a CSS Framework to create a website.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> This is an example of a web page I created using a HTML and JavaScript to create a simple Mad Lib. Thise project was create to show my creativity when using JavaScript to make a fun application.  
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> This is an example of a web page I created using HTML and JavaScript. The primary goal of this project was to get the user's age from and convert it to their Mars age.
</p>
<p> With this project, I use promps via JavaScript to get the user's birthday, then use a formula and JavaScript functions to convert the age to Mars years. 
</p>
<p>This projec showcases my ability to take user input data, use a function to convert the date, then output the date for the user.
