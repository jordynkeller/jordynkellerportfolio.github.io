<h2> Projects</h2>
<br>
<p>This is an example of using SASS and HTM to create a simple website, quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>With this project, I was to use SASS as my CSS processor. I also had to employ as much HTML as needed to ensure all of the following SCSS functionality were met; variables, nesting, mixins, extend/inheritance, and operatiors.
</p>
<p>This project showcases my experience with using CSS processors such as SASS.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> This is an example of a web page I created using a CSS Framework. The primary goal of this project was to give me the ability and practice creating and using a CSS framework to develop a website.
</p>
<p> With this project, I was to create a one-page website using a CSS Framework of my choosing and to use at least 5 components of my choice (buttons, grids, cards, modals, etc). 
</p>
<p>This projec showcases my experience with using a CSS Framework to create a website.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This is an example of a personal website that I designed and developed myself.
</p>
<p>With this project, I was to create a functioning website with a minimum of 4 pages, use HTML5 semantic elements, properly organize code with HTML elements properly nested, at least 1 external style sheet properly linked to each page, a minimum of at least one CSS style applied for padding, margin, border, width, color, background-color, and font-family, create relevant content related to subject, and include at least 1 heading, 1 list, 1 paragraph and 1 image per page.
</p>
<p>This project was extensive and showcases my ability and experience with creating a functional, multipage website.

<h2> About </h2>
<p> As a Web Development and Design student as LCSC, I am still new and learning about development and design, but I am eager to start building my portfolio. I have great communication skills, a keen eye for detail, and a drive to give my clients exactly what they are looking for.</p> 
<p>Since graduating in May 2017 with my Bachelor’s in Business Administration, with a Marketing Minor, I have been working in Customer Service and Marketing Management for a knife company called, SURVIVE!, LLC. Through my current occupation, I have acquired a basic knowledge of web development by maintaining and updating the company website. Coming back to Lewis Clark State College I am pursuing a second Bachelor’s in Web Design and Development in hopes to expand my knowledge and benefit my future endeavors.
</p>
<p> All works featured below have been designed and developed during my time as a student at LCSC.
